# misc

This repo is justa mish mash of random Angular / Ruby on Rails projects.

## Basic Descriptions

### AngularOne (Unfinished, learn user functionality first)

Simple Todo List App.  Eventually, it will connect to the APIone Rails DB to allow users to create accounts / make todo lists.

### APIone (Unfinished(potentially))

Fairly Simple Rails DB that, via postman, can create users and allow them to add todo lists / todo items.

### Heroes (Unfinished, Tutorial Didn't Cover Users, just Client Side Routing and a fake DB)

Angular Tutorial.  I believe it should illustrate proper routing and multiple components when finished so I will be able to build AngularOne the way that I want.

I will most likely be distracted by this for a while as I have decided to make this into a tool to create DnD, Pathfinder, etc. characters.

### Users

Welp, onto the next tutorial as none of them so far have taught me how to work with a DB/API really.  And if they have, I am too dense to jerry-rig something up.
