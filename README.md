# misc

This repo is justa mish mash of random Angular / Ruby on Rails projects.

## Basic Descriptions

### AngularOne

Simple Todo List App.  Eventually, it will connect to the APIone Rails DB to allow users to create accounts / make todo lists.

### APIone

Fairly Simple Rails DB that, via postman, can create users and allow them to add todo lists / todo items.

### Heroes

Angular Tutorial.  I believe it should illustrate proper routing and multiple components when finished so I will be able to build AngularOne the way that I want.
